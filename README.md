# chat_application ðŸ’¬
Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I created a chat application that allows for real-time communication to occur. This application uses: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Socket.io to create this project. This project allows for communication to occur when someone eneters the passcode for the chatroom they want to enter.
